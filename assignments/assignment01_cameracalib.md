# BildComp SoSe 2022 - Assignment #01 - Camera Calibration

## Task
Implement and execute the camera calibration process with Python and OpenCV. Based on the found camera parameters implement a script that displays undistorted camera images. Write a readme file that explains what you have done and how to run the script and what the script does.

## Hints
You can follow the [OpenCV tutorial on camera calibration](https://docs.opencv.org/4.5.5/dc/dbb/tutorial_py_calibration.html), if all code is referenced properly. Do not simply copy the code and text, but describe your process in your own words.

Check out [this project](https://github.com/othneildrew/Best-README-Template) to get an impression about a good readme file.

## Rating
- Write a script that allows capturing a set of images for the calibration. (2 points)
- Print out a calibration pattern and capture a set of images of it. Store all needed data in appropriate data structures or files. (2 points)
- Write a script that computes the camera parameters. (1 point)
- Write a script that undistorts the live image from a camera. (1 point)
- BONUS: Write a script that computes the reprojection error for one image in mm, including a explanatory output and documentation how to use it. (2 points)
- Code is well readable, structured and documented. And it can be well explained in the consultation. (up to 2 points)
- Code fullfils the [PEP8 styleguide](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/). (1 point)
- Readme is well written and helpful. It contains all used modules and their version. (1 point)

## Acceptance criteria
- Hand in code (.py files), accompanying images or videos and short explanation (readme.md file) either as one zip file or as a link to a public github respository via FELIX. If you use a Github link, please create a tag of the final version before the deadline.
- The reamde file should be no longer than 600 words, it can be German or English.
- The code is written mainly on your own and any other source is mentioned in the code. If two groups hand in the same or extremely similar solution, both groups do not pass the assignment.

## Pass criteria
- The assignment is passed, if 5 or more points are reached.
